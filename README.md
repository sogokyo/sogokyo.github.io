1. I’ve not used it before yet, but what do you reckon to Dreamweaver?
2. What size photos should I be making pages if responsive?
3. What’s the difference between specifying font-weight and using the font-style? (e.g. Helvetica Bold)
4. Can I have a list without <ol> or <ul> tags?
5. How can I range a block of text left, but have it centered?
6. Why do hex colors come out differently sometimes when creating from CMYK? Values are different on PS and color.adobe.com color wheel. 
7. You can create transparencies in RGB with an alpha value. Can you do it with hex or named colors?
8. How can I change the color of one word within a line of text?
9. How can I range left a short horizontal line?
10. Can I change the color of the line? 
11. How do I get rid of the gap in between masthead and “News from Asia” and the line, essentially making them touch? Better to wait for other units to learn how to make boxes?
12. Do I do the same thing if I want to narrow spaces in between lines of text — specifically at the end, just above the list?
13. How do I change the color of the anchor href and take out the underline?
14. What screen size should I generally work to? 1024 x 768?
15. When can I realistically start using special fonts? Is it difficult and expensive to embed them?
16. Why isn’t my photo changing size depending on the browser window size? I used the same coding from GA’s New York photo which incidentally changed size only up to a certain point.
